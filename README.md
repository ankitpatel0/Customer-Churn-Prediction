📊 Customer Churn Prediction
🧠 Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a business. In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, understanding and predicting churn is vital for customer retention and business sustainability.

This project employs machine learning techniques to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. By analyzing customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns, the model identifies customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive retention strategies.
