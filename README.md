📉 Customer Churn Prediction
📌 Overview
The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to identify customers who are likely to discontinue a service, enabling proactive retention strategies. By analyzing customer data and leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model predicts churn with high accuracy—helping businesses make informed decisions to improve customer satisfaction and reduce losses.

🚀 Features
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing data distributions and uncovering relationships to gain actionable insights.

Model Training
Implementing various machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn.

Model Evaluation
Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Model Deployment
Saving and exporting the best-performing model using joblib for future predictions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language
Python

Libraries
Pandas – for data manipulation

NumPy – for numerical computations

Scikit-learn – for machine learning models and evaluation
